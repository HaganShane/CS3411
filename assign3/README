I believe I got steps 1,2,3,4,5,6 to work for sure. Step 7 I was confused with the killing, I knew I had to put it in a for loop that would last until the remaining players was not 1. I did get the processes working, along with the piping between children and parent. The program works as far as randomizing the deck, dealing 4 cards to each player present in the game. I ran out of time and was a little confused with how to terminate each loser for the round. I never got around to deciding between ties as well, I was going to perfect everything in the final step when I copied over to the dealer.c, but I was moreso consuming time with the piping and forking. I was also able to successfully split up some of the steps into various functions (i.e., the shuffling to easily call whenever, the dealing to easily call in case of regular and ties). I also added the infinite loop to the player.c file, even though I did not have it functioning correctly. I moreso just wanted to show what I was able to do / knew what needed to be done there in as few lines as possible, hopefully for some type of credit because I know the assignment is not 100% complete and will not recieve all possible points. The Makefile also makes every step, along with the dealer executable.
