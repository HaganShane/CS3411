For this assignment, I could only get the -a flag to work. Steps 1,2,4, and 6 all are working. I was able to do that functionality because it was all relatively the same (as far as creating an archive with a single file versus multiple files, or appending to an existing one). I was not able to figure out the -e flag unfortunately, I could get close but didn't grasp a full understanding and implementation for it. I came close I believe where I had the extracted file name as "CS3411TAR", but couldn't figure out how to consistently get the correct file name and data into that file. I'm sure I was close to getting it, I just couldn't figure it out. I figured moving on with the -a and getting some points back was the right move, given I was lost with the -e and extraction of the files. I was also on track with the overwritting files, but clearly that didn't matter if I couldn't even get the simple extraction of a file correct.
