The first 4 steps in the criteria work. I couldn't really figure out much with this assignment if I'm being honest. The 5th step could *technically* work (it can hold 5 connections at once because I changed the argument in the listen call). I also did the other way for the exit step (just using the standard input with no select call). All in all, the server setting up the ports and establishing a connection with the client works, along with the messages being sent back and forth. The client can also type exit and it will exit. The remanining steps aren't finished (nicknames, personal input chat, other server messages).
