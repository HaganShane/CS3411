I tested as I went along. For the first step I tested using the telnet in another terminal to ensure the connection was actually being established. For the second step I tested with a Hello world! message, and once that worked I changed around the message to see it working in real time. For the third step I would type random words into the terminal, and THEN type exit to make sure it worked, along with just typing exit right off the bat (both worked). I really only tested with ensuring the connection was established and mixing around the messages being sent, along with trying to get the correct operation upon the client typing exit.
